# libcardgen
Generate printable, barcoded library cards!

If you need a simple way for staff to generate a basic, temporary library card for your patrons then this may offer a useful starting point for further development.

Uses [JsBarcode](https://github.com/lindell/JsBarcode) to generate barcodes from numeric input. This example is configured to generate [Codabar](https://github.com/lindell/JsBarcode/wiki/codabar) barcodes. See [JsBarcode documentation](https://github.com/lindell/JsBarcode/wiki) for info about how to generate other barcode types to suit your needs.
